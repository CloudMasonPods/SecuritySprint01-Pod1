# üë©‚Äçüíº Scenario:
You are part of the DevOps team at CryptoSecure, a fast-growing startup specializing in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency solutions. CryptoSecure has been gaining attention in the market for its innovative approaches to secure transactions and wallet management. However, with the rise in cyber threats, especially in the cryptocurrency domain, there's an increasing need to bolster the security of your infrastructure and deployment pipeline.


# Objective:
As part of CryptoSecure's DevOps team, your ultimate goal is to implement and enforce robust security measures throughout the deployment pipelines and production operations. This initiative is critical to safeguarding CryptoSecure's blockchain technology and cryptocurrency solutions against the increasing threat landscape.

# Deploy Ethereum Blockchain
- use the [ethereum helm chart](https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-helm-charts) to deploy an Ethereum blockchain on the Kubernetes cluster.



# Supply Chain Security

## Tasks: 
### Container Signing 
Implement a mechanism within your CI/CD pipeline that mandates signing the Ethereum container image to ensure their integrity and authenticity before they are pulled into the production cluster. Utilize cryptographic signatures to establish provenance, ensuring that only verified images are deployed.

### Notification System 
Notification System: Develop a real-time alert system that notifies the relevant team members whenever an image without proper provenance is attempted to be pulled into the cluster. This system should log all such incidents for audit purposes and trigger an automated response to block the pull request until the image can be verified.



## CVE Handling 
### CVE Scanning 
Set up a Continuous Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) monitoring system tailored to the specific technologies used within your application stack. This system should automatically scan for new vulnerabilities and alert the team.


### Patch Process 
Create a streamlined process for the rapid assessment, prioritization, and patching of vulnerabilities identified by the CVE monitoring system. This process should include a fast-track for critical vulnerabilities that could directly impact the security of cryptographic operations and sensitive data.

## Secret Management with HashiCorp Vault
### HC Vault Integration
 Integrate HashiCorp Vault into your deployment pipeline to securely manage secrets, such as API keys, cryptographic keys, and credentials. Ensure that access to these secrets is tightly controlled and audited, with policies in place to automatically rotate secrets on a regular schedule or in response to specific security events.


## Threat Detection and Response ( Extra Credit)

### Advanced Monitoring: 
Implement advanced threat detection mechanisms that monitor for suspicious activities within your infrastructure and deployment pipeline. This includes anomaly detection, unauthorized access attempts, and signs of insider threats.

### Incident Response:
 Develop a robust incident response plan that includes immediate containment actions, detailed forensic analysis, and a recovery strategy to restore any affected systems or data. This plan should be regularly updated and tested through drills and simulations.



 # Deliverables:
- An Ethereum node using the security aparatis.
- A secure CI/CD pipeline that enforces image signing and provenance verification.
- An operational CVE monitoring and patching workflow.
- HashiCorp Vault integration for enhanced secret management.
- A comprehensive threat detection and incident response framework.
## Extra Credit 
- A real-time alert and logging system for supply chain security breaches.
